### Hi there 👋 Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm Caleb Walls, a graduate student in Informatics with a deep passion for exploring the realms of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Applications Development.

In addition to my enthusiasm for coding and problem-solving, a background in education and the humanities inspires my diverse range of interests. I'm always looking to push the boundaries of my knowledge, often through projects that blend various fields such as NLP, Educational Theory, Cognitive Science, Virtual Reality, Game Theory, and many others.

🛠️ Below, I've included some of my current technical proficiencies, with many more tools, languages, and libraries on the agenda to learn soon:

Programming Languages: R, SQL, Python, Visual Basic, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
Development Tools: VS Code, R Studio, Git, GitHub
Data Analysis Tools: Tableau, Ggplot2, Knime Analytics, Predictive Modeling
Operating Systems: Windows, Linux

🚀 I'm open to collaboration of any kind, so please reach out if you have an open job position or an idea for a startup, open-source project, or other form of technical endeavor!
